## Key Features

- **Deep Research**: Given a report topic and desired report structure, an agent (1) creates a report plan, (2) searches data sources for answers, (3) writes a report, (4) reflects on gaps in the report for further queries, (5) finishes a report with a list of sources.
- **Parallel Search**: During the research phase, multiple research questions are searched in parallel. For each query, the RAG service is consulted and an LLM-as-a-judge is used to check the relevancy of the results. If more information is needed, a fallback web search is performed. This search approach ensures internal documents are given preference over generic web results while maintaining accuracy. Performing query search in parallel allows for many data sources to be consulted in an efficient manner.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Human feedback on the report plan, interactive report edits, and Q&A with the final report.
- **Data Sources**: Integration with the NVIDIA RAG blueprint to search multimodal documents with text, charts, and tables. Optional web search through Tavily.
- **Demo Web Application**: Frontend web application showcasing end-to-end use of the AI-Q Research Assistant.

## Target Audience

- *Research Analysts:* This blueprint can be deployed by IT organizations to provide an on-premise deep research application for analysts
- *Developers:* This blueprint serves as a reference architecture for teams to adapt to their own AI research applications  

## Software Components 

The AI-Q Research Assistant blueprint provides these components:

- **Demo Frontend**: A docker container with a fully functional demo web application is provided. This web application is deployed by default if you follow the getting started guides and is the easiest way to quickly experiment with deep research using internal data sources via the NVIDA RAG blueprint. The source code for this demo web application is not distributed. 
- **Backend Service via RESTful API**: The main AI-Q Research Assistant code is distributed as the `aiq-aira` Python package located in the `/aira` directory. These backend functions are available directly or via a RESTful API.
- **Middleware Proxy**: An nginx proxy is deployed as part of the getting started guides. This proxy enables frontend web applications to interact with a single backend service. In turn, the proxy routes requests between the NVIDIA RAG blueprint services and the AI-Q Research Assistant service.

Additionally, the blueprint uses these components:

- [**NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit)
  Provides a toolkit for managing a LangGraph codebase. Provides observability, API services and documentation, and easy configuration of different LLMs.
- [**NVIDIA RAG Blueprint**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag)
  Provides a solution for querying large sets of on-premise multi-modal documents.
- [**NVIDIA NeMo Retriever Microservices**](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-retriever?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured_in.nemo_retriever%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc&hitsPerPage=12)
- [**NVIDIA NIM Microservices**](https://developer.nvidia.com/nim?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured_in.nim%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc&hitsPerPage=12) 
  Used through the RAG blueprint for multi-modal document ingestion.
  Provides the foundational LLMs used for report writing and reasoning, including the Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1 reasoning model.
- [**Web search powered by Tavily**](https://tavily.com/)
  Supplements on-premise sources with real-time web search.

## Security Considerations

- The AI-Q Research Assistant Blueprint doesn't generate any code that may require sandboxing.
- The AI-Q Research Assistant Blueprint is shared as a reference and is provided "as is". The security in the production environment is the responsibility of the end users deploying it. When deploying in a production environment, please have security experts review any potential risks and threats; define the trust boundaries, implement logging and monitoring capabilities, secure the communication channels, integrate AuthN & AuthZ with appropriate access controls, keep the deployment up to date, ensure the containers/source code are secure and free of known vulnerabilities.
- A frontend that handles AuthN & AuthZ should be in place as missing AuthN & AuthZ could provide ungated access to customer models if directly exposed to e.g. the internet, resulting in either cost to the customer, resource exhaustion, or denial of service.
- The AI-Q Research Assistant doesn't require any privileged access to the system.
- The end users are responsible for ensuring the availability of their deployment.
- The end users are responsible for building the container images and keeping them up to date.
- The end users are responsible for ensuring that OSS packages used by the developer blueprint are current.
- The logs from nginx proxy, backend, and demo app are printed to standard out. They can include input prompts and output completions for development purposes. The end users are advised to handle logging securely and avoid information leakage for production use cases.
